Why TDD
===

* TDD is a **design** process, not a **testing** process.
* Regression tests are a **side product** of the process, not the goal.
* Using TDD results in fundamentally better code than not using it.
* You will feel the same way by the end of the day.

!

Why today?
===

Today's goal is to teach you the **skill** of TDD by
explanation, demonstration, and **participation**.

**Be skeptical**: the best way to justify TDD is by doing it.
If you're still not convinced, talk to me.

Legacy Code
===

* Today is focused on new code,
  but it is vital for legacy code as well.
* More on this when Michael Feathers visits CCP in late October.

!


Pair Programming
===

...is a tenet of eXtreme Programming and valuable when learning TDD.

* All exercises will be done in pairs.
* You should not pair with the same person twice.
* Leads to huge gains on production work!

Let's get started!
