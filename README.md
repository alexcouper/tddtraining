tddtraining
===========

Resources for a TDD training course. 
Initially created for a TDD in Python training for CCP developers
at CCP Reykjavik, Iceland.
Feel free to adapt and use for your own training,
but please give me feedback if you find it useful.

Presenting

Create or modify the presentations in `presentations` directory.
Call `python start.py [--port portno] -p <path to markdown file>`
to run a web server on a given port.

Call `python start.py -u -p <path to markdown file>`
to update the source presentation file so you can hit
Spacebar to reload the presentation from the web browser.
